# Insta-Influencers-Analytics
This Power BI project analyzes a curated dataset of top Instagram influencers to uncover insights on engagement, reach, and regional influence. The dashboard is structured into four insightful pages—Executive Summary, Engagement & Influence Analytics, Country & Regional Insights, and Influencer Deep Dive—each tailored to specific business audiences. A comprehensive set of measures and calculated KPIs were developed, including metrics such as total followers, average engagement rate, like-to-follower ratio, and post efficiency. Visualizations were selected strategically to convey meaningful patterns, with alternatives provided for box plots and histograms using native Power BI charts like scatter plots, column charts with binned data, and strip plots. This project follows a structured business analyst approach to drive actionable insights from social media influencer data.
